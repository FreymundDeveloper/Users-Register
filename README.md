# Users-Register

A basic CRUD user registration system, linked to a database.

Some technologies used:

* React;
* Html;
* CSS;
* JavaScript;
* Jest;
* PostgreSQL;
* Bootstrap;
* Node;
* Express.

All routes are linked to the "localhost:3001/users ..." address. The backend runs on port 3001 and the frontend on port 3000.

## Running the app

**Required**: It is recommended to have the PostgreSQL database installed on your machine.

```bash
# Installation
$ npm install

# Running
# Open two terminals and go to "cd ./frontend" in one, and "cd ./backend" in the other. Then run:
$ npm run start

# Running without a database
$ npm run start-local

# Running Test
# Go to "cd ./frontend". Then run:
$ npm run test
```

Obs: Adjust the password according to your PostgreSQL configuration.
